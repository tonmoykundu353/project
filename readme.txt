OOP Concepts Used in the Code:
1. Inheritance: The User class inherits from the Virtual_func class. This allows User to inherit and implement the pure virtual functions defined in the Virtual_func class.
2. Encapsulation: The classes encapsulate data and related member functions. The User class encapsulates attributes such as username, password, department name, batch year, and roll. The UserManager class encapsulates the collection of users and provides member functions to perform operations on users.
3. Abstraction: The Virtual_func class defines a pure virtual interface that specifies the required functions for derived classes. This allows for abstraction and polymorphism by providing a common interface for different types of users.
4. Polymorphism: The Virtual_func class defines pure virtual functions, and the User class inherits and implements these functions according to its specific requirements. The UserManager class utilizes polymorphism by storing objects of the User class in a vector and accessing their common interface through the base class pointer.
5. Templates: The String class is a template class that allows flexibility in handling different types of strings. It provides member functions to get a name and password as strings.


Project Overview:
The project is an Alumni Record System that allows users to register as alumni and perform various operations. Here's a brief overview of how it works:
1. The program starts with a login screen where users can enter their username and password.
2. The UserManager class handles user registration, login, and management operations. It maintains a vector of User objects to store registered alumni.
3. Upon successful login, the user can choose from the following options:
• Show Alumni List: Displays the list of all registered alumni or alumni from a specific department.
• Search Alumni: Allows the user to search for a specific alumni by name.
• Delete Alumni: Allows the user to delete a registered alumni from the list.
4. User registration prompts the user to enter their name, department name, batch year, and roll. Optionally, they can provide a password or use their roll as the default password.
5. The program utilizes OOP concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, and templates to implement the functionality and manage user data.
Overall, the project provides a basic system for managing alumni records, allowing users to register, login, view the alumni list, search for alumni, and delete alumni from the system.
